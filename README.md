- Passable: The flaw is identified correctly, the fix partially corrects the problem. The underlying problem and the effect of the fix is somewhat misuderstood.
- Average: The flaw described adequately and the fix fixes the problem. Minor misunderstanding of the underlying mechanism. The description is too vague but ultimately correct.
- Good: The flaw and the fix are correctly done. Minor issues in descriptions.
- Excellent: No issues or only cosmetic issues
